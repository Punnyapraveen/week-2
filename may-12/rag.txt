Agentic RAG :

Agentic RAG is the use of AI agents to facilitate retrieval augmented generation (RAG). Agentic RAG systems add AI agents to the RAG pipeline to increase adaptability and accuracy. Compared to traditional RAG systems, agentic RAG allows large language models (LLMs) to conduct information retrieval from multiple sources and handle more complex workflows.gentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) combines the power of both retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. In traditional AI systems, models rely solely on their training data, which may limit their ability to provide up-to-date or domain-specific answers. Agentic RAG solves this problem by incorporating a dynamic retrieval process. The model autonomously retrieves relevant information from external databases or knowledge sources before generating a response, ensuring more informed and contextually relevant outputs.

The "agentic" aspect refers to the systemâ€™s ability to make autonomous decisions about what information to retrieve and how to incorporate it into its generation process. This allows the system to actively search for data, ensuring that it can provide more accurate answers, even for complex or specific queries. By combining retrieval with generation, the model can leverage both its pre-existing knowledge and real-time, external data.

This approach is particularly useful in applications like conversational AI, semantic search, and customer support, where the AI must respond accurately to queries based on both internal knowledge and external resources. Agentic RAG enables the AI to access real-time information, ensuring its responses are more relevant and accurate, especially in dynamic environments. Overall, this method boosts the performance of AI systems, making them more adaptable and capable of handling complex tasks.
