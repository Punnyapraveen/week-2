Vector database :


A vector database stores, manages and indexes high-dimensional vector data. Data points are stored as arrays of numbers called “vectors,” which are clustered based on similarity. This design enables low-latency queries, making it ideal for AI applications.Vector databases are specialized data management systems designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vector representations of data, commonly known as embeddings. These embeddings are numerical representations of complex data types like text, images, or audio, generated using machine learning models. Vector databases enable efficient similarity search, allowing users to find items that are most similar to a given input, which is crucial in applications such as recommendation systems, semantic search, facial recognition, and natural language understanding. Unlike traditional databases that rely on exact matching, vector databases use techniques like approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search to compare vectors based on their distance in multidimensional space. Popular vector databases include FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone, Weaviate, and ChromaDB—each offering different trade-offs between scalability, ease of use, and deployment flexibility. ChromaDB, in particular, is gaining traction for its lightweight, Python-native design, making it ideal for rapid prototyping and integration with language models in local environments.
Each vector in a vector database corresponds to an object or item, whether that is a word, an image, a video, a movie, a document, or any other piece of data. These vectors are likely to be lengthy and complex, expressing the location of each object along dozens or even hundreds of dimensions.
For example, a vector database of movies may locate movies along dimensions like running time, genre, year released, parental guidance rating, number of actors in common, number of viewers in common, and so on. If these vectors are created accurately, then similar movies are likely to end up clustered together in the vector database.
